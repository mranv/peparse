# PE Parser and Loader in Rust

This project is a Rust implementation of a PE (Portable Executable) parser and loader. It provides functionality to parse and analyze the structure of 64-bit PE files, extract various headers and sections, and load the executable into a target process.

## Features

- Parse and verify the validity of 64-bit PE files
- Extract and analyze various PE headers (DOS header, NT headers, section headers)
- Retrieve information about exported functions and import dependencies
- Load the PE executable into a target process, handling import resolution, base relocation, and entry point execution
- Swap export ordinals of exported functions within a DLL

## Usage

To use the PE parser and loader, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Build the project using Cargo (Rust's package manager).
3. Run the compiled binary with the appropriate command-line arguments.

```
cargo run --release <path_to_pe_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_pe_file>` with the actual path to the PE file you want to analyze or load.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the PE parser and loader:

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let arguments = env::args().collect::<Vec<String>>();

    if arguments.len() != 2 {
        println!("Usage: cargo run --release <path_to_pe_file>");
        return;
    }

    let mut pe = peparse64::parsefile(arguments[1].to_string());
    if !pe.ispefile() {
        println!("Invalid PE file, currently accepting only 64-bit executables");
        return;
    }

    // Parse and analyze the PE file
    let exports = pe.getexports();
    for (dll_name, exports) in exports {
        println!("DLL Name: {}", dll_name);
        for export in exports {
            for (func_name, rva) in export {
                println!("  Function Name: {}, RVA: 0x{:x}", func_name, rva);
            }
        }
    }

    // Load the PE file into a target process
    let target_process_handle = // ... Get the handle to the target process

    let load_result = pe.load(target_process_handle);
    match load_result {
        Ok(message) => println!("{}", message),
        Err(error) => println!("Error loading PE file: {}", error),
    }
}
```

# Rust PE Parser and Loader

This is a Rust implementation of a PE (Portable Executable) parser and loader. It provides functionality to parse and analyze the structure of 64-bit PE files, extract various headers and sections, retrieve information about exported functions and imported dependencies, and load the executable into a target process.

## Features

- Parse and verify the validity of 64-bit PE files
- Extract and analyze various PE headers (DOS header, NT headers, section headers)
- Retrieve information about exported functions, including forwarded exports
- Retrieve information about imported functions and their dependencies
- Load the PE executable into a target process, handling import resolution, base relocation, and entry point execution
- Swap export ordinals of exported functions within a DLL

## Usage

To use the PE parser and loader, you can either include it as a dependency in your Rust project or run the provided binary with the appropriate command-line arguments.

### Running the Binary

1. Build the project using Cargo (Rust's package manager):

```
cargo build --release
```

2. Run the compiled binary with the path to the PE file as an argument:

```
target/release/pe_parser_loader <path_to_pe_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_pe_file>` with the actual path to the PE file you want to analyze or load.

### Using as a Library

1. Add this project as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
pe_parser_loader = { git = "https://github.com/mranv/peparse" }
```

2. Import the necessary modules and use the provided functionality in your Rust code.

```rust
use pe_parser_loader::peparse64;

fn main() {
    let mut pe = peparse64::parsefile("path/to/file.exe".to_string());
    if pe.ispefile() {
        // Parse and analyze the PE file
        let exports = pe.getexports();
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the PE parser and loader:

```rust
use std::env;
use pe_parser_loader::peparse64;

fn main() {
    let arguments = env::args().collect::<Vec<String>>();

    if arguments.len() != 2 {
        println!("Usage: cargo run --release <path_to_pe_file>");
        return;
    }

    let mut pe = peparse64::parsefile(arguments[1].to_string());
    if !pe.ispefile() {
        println!("Invalid PE file, currently accepting only 64-bit executables");
        return;
    }

    // Parse and analyze the PE file
    let exports = pe.getexports();
    for (dll_name, exports) in exports {
        println!("DLL Name: {}", dll_name);
        for export in exports {
            for (func_name, rva) in export {
                println!("  Function Name: {}, RVA: 0x{:x}", func_name, rva);
            }
        }
    }

    // Load the PE file into a target process
    let target_process_handle = // ... Get the handle to the target process
    let load_result = pe.load(target_process_handle);
    match load_result {
        Ok(message) => println!("{}", message),
        Err(error) => println!("Error loading PE file: {}", error),
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to parse a PE file, retrieve information about its exported functions, and load the executable into a target process.
